Can we make amends? Do we just pretend
That we're over all the violence?
Are we done with this? Put it all to rest,
Turn the screams now into silence.
Will you be a man? Can you make a stand?
Will you own up or deny it all?
All the time we lost, was it worth the cost
Of breaking a family in two?
Destroyed all we knew.
